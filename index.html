        <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
        <p>and the thunder shook the ground beneath her feet.</p>
        <p>Ursula was scrambling to find the correct key on the keychain to get
            out of the rain as quickly as possible.</p>
        <p>"Why does this stupid house have so many different doors?" she grumbled.</p>
        <p>She found the right key as quickly as she could 
            and spilled her way into the cold lonely mansion dropping all of her school books.</p>
